## Data Types

In this section, you will learn about the primitive data types built-in to C, the special data types afforded them by the CS50 Library, the qualifiers that can be applied to data types, and the difference between static and dynamic typing.

- ### Thought Questions
  - Why is C so inflexible with data types? (Hint: Consider its history relative to modern language)
  - Imagine we don't have data types. What's `10 + "10"`? Is it `"1010"` or `"20"` (strings) or `1010` or `20` (ints)?
  - In what situations would it be preferable to use a double versus a float, or a long long versus an int? (Or vice versa)
