## Scratch

Scratch is a programming language designed to help introduce computer science principles while minimizing the amount of syntax you need to learn to use the language. Scratch works by letting you drag-and-drop blocks together to create a program, which is this case is just a sequence of blocks that produce some effect. There are a lot of different blocks that you can experiment with in Scratch, and Scratch is smart enough to only allow you to put blocks together when it makes sense to do so.
