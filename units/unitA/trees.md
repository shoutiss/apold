## Trees

Trees are a way to organize data that can give more information than a simple list. Trees are made of nodes, with one root node. Each node has pointers to the next node down the tree (or NULL if the node is at the lowest level). If tree data is sorted, such as in a Binary Search Tree, operations like searching can become much more efficient. This section goes over the basics of trees and briefly introduces Binary Search Trees.
