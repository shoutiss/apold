## Ajax

Ajax (which formerly stood for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a web programming technique that lets us dynamically update the content of the web page. We can make snappier web pages that do not reload every time additional content is requested. Here, we see how this technique can be accomplished using JavaScript, in which an HTTP request is made asynchronously (in the background) to the server, and a callback function handles the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object that is returned.

- ### Thought Questions
  - Is Ajax essential? If so, why? If not, why do we have it?
  - What common websites seem to be using Ajax, and how can you tell?
  - In what cases would Ajax be useful? What wouldn't work without Ajax?
  - How does Ajax to update web applications asynchronously? How is this different from what we have done in our previous applications?
  - What technologies does Ajax use? Would you consider Ajax its own technology?
