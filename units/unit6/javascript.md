## JavaScript

Python gave us the opportunity to build dynamic websites, but JavaScript lets us take things even further, permitting client-side modifications to our web pages, making them more dynamic without requiring contact with a database or off-site server, which can greatly improve the user experience. In this module, you will get an introduction to the basic power of JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM), which JavaScript is able to manipulate to literally change the contents of a website, albeit temporarily, in response to user interactions.

  - JavaScript and Python are both programming languages. In web development, when should you use JavaScript and when should you use Python?
  - Why is it important to separate client-side scripts (JavaScript) from server side scripts (Python)?
  - What is the purpose of JavaScript? How does the purpose of JavaScript impact its design?
