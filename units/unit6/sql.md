## SQL

SQL (the Structured Query Language) is a language that we can use to create, add to, select, modify, and delete information in connection with a database. By learning how to use SQL we can create a so-called "backend" for our websites, allowing us to store persistent user data (sort of like the notion of a `FILE*` in C) that we can access when necessary to improve the user experience on a page.

- ### Thought Questions
  - Open up  phpLiteAdmin in your IDE and try each of the basic operations (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) using the graphical tabs. Then repeat all of the basic operations only using the SQL tab. Why is it advantageous that we can do this both ways?
  - How is the notion of a database different from file management with C?
  - What are some of the advantages of SQL over, say, a CSV file? What are some of the disadvantages?
