- ### Thought Questions
  - When would you want to use `GET`? When would you instead want to use `POST`? What is the use case for wanting to use `SESSION`?
  - Is `POST` more secure than `GET`? Is it secure enough?
  - How else might we be able to pass information between pages on our website?
  - Why is Python used for back end web programming? What other languages could you use?
