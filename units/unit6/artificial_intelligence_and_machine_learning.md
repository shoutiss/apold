## Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

An intelligent machine is one that can analyze a set of circumstances and make a conclusion about those circumstances without contemporaneous direct human intervention. The definition of what makes a machine "intelligent", however, varies over time. In this capstone section, we take a look at some of the current trends in the study of machine intelligence.

  - Want to have a conversation with the ELIZA chatbot? The original source code for ELIZA has been modified for C, and you can download this [file](http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/lectures/10/w/src10w/eliza.c) to your CS50 IDE and compile it to start your chat!
  - Take a look at this [article](https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/main/gender-equality-films/) by Google on using machine learning to analyze female representation in movies.

- ### Thought Questions
  - How should ethical dilemmas be handled with artificial intelligence? For instance, if a self driving car can steer away from a group of 10 people to a group of 5, should it be programmed to?
  - Why do humans playing board games not have to consider as many possibilities as AIs do? How do they limit which possibilities they consider?
  - Are there limits to what artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies can do? What are those limits?
  - How are artificial intelligence and machine learning different?
  - How can artificial intelligence and machine learning affect the economy?
  - Can artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms be biased? How is this possible and how does it manifest in real life?
  - Are artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms always trustworthy?
