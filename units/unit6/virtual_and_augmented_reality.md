## Virtual and Augmented Reality

Virtual and augmented reality has recently taken the world by storm. Virtual reality allows a user to jump into a three dimensional world so to speak to experience games, videos and other simulations in a new way. Augmented reality is similar in spirit to virtual reality, only that instead of taking you away from your surroundings completely, the effects, videos, or games are over layed to tie in your surroundings with the technology. In this section, you will explore the difference between the two and discover what advances can be made with this technology.

- ### Thought Questions
  - What other fields could benefit from VR and AR?
  - Who could benefit from VR and AR?
  - What ethical issues might one encounter when working with VR and AR?
  - What kind of negative consequences could be associated with VR and AR?
  - How could some of today's technologies be different after applying VR/AR technology?
