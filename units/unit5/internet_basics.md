- ### Thought Questions
  - How fundamental is the Internet to your everyday life? Could you live without it? What about on a global scale? To what extent do we rely on the Internet?
  - Imagine that your computer has just lost its connection to the Internet. What are the places you should look to find the problem?
  - What are the advantages of using an [Ethernet](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-ethernet-cable-817548) cable over [Wi-Fi](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-wi-fi-2377430) to connect a device to the Internet? (Hint: Consider speed, reliability, and practicality.)
  - Given the many different components that comprise an internet connection, how do we ensure all of them work together properly? (Hint: What do we mean by "protocols" and why do they matter? What "protocols" do you use in your everyday life?)
