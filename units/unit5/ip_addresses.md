## IP Addresses

IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are assigned to each device connected to a network. A device or web page can be identified by its IP addresses, as all are unique - like a postal address. There are also private IP addresses, which can be used in an internal network but not on the Internet at large.

- ### Thought Questions
  - Can you think of potential problems if two devices were to have the same IP address on a network? (Hint: It would be very difficult to discern which device was performing which operations, such as with [MAC spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_spoofing).)
  - What do you think will happen when we run out of valid IP addresses? (Hint: A temporary [solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion) has been created, but it's not perfect.)
  - If currently connected to the Internet, what is your computer's IP address? Will it always stay the same? If it changes, why might that be?
