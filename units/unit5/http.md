## HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, is what web browsers use to speak to web servers. There are two major types of HTTP requests used by browsers: GET and POST. The server receives the request and either successfully executes the action (by rendering a page or submitting a form, for example) or returns an error code. These "success" or "error" codes are called HTTP status codes.

- ### Thought Questions
  - In what circumstances would you want a GET request? A POST request?
  - Can you list some of the common HTTP status codes?
  - What is HTTPS and why is it important? (Hint: Check out this [article](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/281633) if unsure about what HTTPS is and how it differs from HTTP.)
