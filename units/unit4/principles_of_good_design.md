## Principles of Good Design

Good design is an important aspect of programming and product development in general. In computer science, good design is what differentiates between a program that works and a program that works well. Good design is key aspect for a program to be portable, scalable, and reusable. Good design includes, but is not limited to, a program that has a fast run-time, is modularized for easy debugging, robust, consistent, and not repetitive in code.

- ### Thought Questions
  -  In more general terms, what is good design?
  - Can you compare two products where one has better design than the other (such as a Samsung phone and an iPhone)?
  - Why is good design important? Why is it important in programs as well as physical objects?
  - How can design be evaluated? What tests or parameters are helpful for doing so?
  - What design choices do you make every day?
