## Images

Images are stored as a number of file types, including but not limited to bitmaps (.bmp), JPGs (.jpg), PNGs (.png), and GIFs (.gif). Each type of file has its advantages and disadvantages, limitations, and more. In this section, you will explore different types of images, and learn about how Hollywood lies to you.

- ### Thought Questions
  - Why do bitmaps have headers?
  - Why should we ever use something that is not a .png?
  - Why are JPGs not always the best file type?
  - How do file types evolve as technology improves?
  - How do different file types balance file size and resolution?
  - In what specific ways are the portrayals of forensic imaging in popular TV shows and movies unrealistic? What advice would you give the producer of a new detective series that wanted to have more plausible shots of photo recovery and enhancement?
  - How are multimedia types expanding? What can be done to accommodate for these new multimedia types?
