## Models and Simulations

Computer programs can be used to create models and simulations, to test hypotheses and generate new understanding and knowledge. You will explore simulations of existing knowledge (like finding the area of a circle) and use simulation software to test models. Simulations are applicable in everyday life, from testing new car designs to modeling possible furniture arrangements. Taking advantage of simulations as a tool can help people and companies save time, money, and effort by modeling new ideas before putting them into production.
