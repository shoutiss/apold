## Collaboration

When coding in real life, especially in industry, it is rare that a person will code a program all by his/herself. Collaboration is a key part to programming, and is a fundamental skill in and out of the field of computer science. Often times, an individual will work on a specific portion of a larger project. Thus, it is important to both understand what others are doing and write code that works with the larger project. Collaboration includes understanding other people's code, which you have done with distribution code in earlier problems, but also includes working with others to discuss algorithms and design ideas which would best solve the problem at hand. This section will give you the experience to program with others.

- ### Thought Questions
  - Why is it important to work with others in a programming context?
  - Are there reasons to collaborate with others even when the assignment I'm given is easy and can be done by one person?
  - Which pairs make the most effective pair programmers? For instance, with an expert and a novice pair, who should be the driver?
